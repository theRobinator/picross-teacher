<div ng-switch on="hintName">
    <div ng-switch-when="Simple Boxes">
        <h3>Simple Boxes</h3>
        <p>
            By testing the left- and right-most positions of the blocks in a row, we can
            find cells that must be filled no matter what. For example, in a row with hints
            of 4 and 3, the third, fourth, and eighth cells can be filled in:
        </p>
        <p class="method-image">
            <img src="/static/images/simpleboxes.png">
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the sixth cell cannot be filled in; this strategy only applies to
            cells where one block overlaps with itself. In this case, it's possible to move
            the block of four one space to the left, meaning that the sixth cell no longer
            overlaps.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div ng-switch-when="Simple Spaces">
        <h3>Simple Spaces</h3>
        <p>
            When cells in a row are already filled, it limits the possible possitions of
            the blocks in that row. Cells that are outside all possible positions can be
            marked empty. For example:
        </p>
        <p class="method-image">
            <img src="/static/images/simplespaces.png">
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the block of 3 can only fill the 2nd through 5th cells, the rest of the
            cells can be marked as spaces.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div ng-switch-when="Punctuation">
        <h3>Punctuation</h3>
        <p>
            When you're sure that a block of cells is complete, it can be safely surrounded
            by spaces.
        </p>
        <p class="method-image">
            <img src="/static/images/punctuation.gif">
        </p>
    </div>
    <div ng-switch-when="Completion">
        <h3>Completion</h3>
        <p>
            When all the blocks in a row are complete, the remaining cells can be filled in
            with spaces.
        </p>
        <p class="method-image">
            <img src="/static/images/completion.gif">
        </p>
    </div>
    <div ng-switch-when="Inner Spaces">
        <h3>Inner Spaces</h3>
        <p>
            Cells between filled-in boxes can be marked as spaces even if the matching cells
            are not shared between blocks. For example, the first filled-in block could be
            the 2 or 1 block:
        </p>
        <p class="method-image">
            <img src="/static/images/innerspaces.gif">
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in either case there must be a space in the sixth cell.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div ng-switch-when="Forced Boxes">
        <h3>Forced Boxes</h3>
        <p>
            When placing a space in a cell would lead to a row that can't be completed, that
            cell can be marked as a box. For example, a space in the fourth cell below would
            lead to a row with two separate blocks in it:
        </p>
        <p class="method-image">
            <img src="/static/images/forcedboxes.gif">
        </p>
        <p>
            Since there is only one hint in this row, it must have only one block, and so
            the fourth cell must be filled in.
        </p>
    </div>
